# Mr. Coffee's coffee maker

Here is what I noticed when interacting with my coffee maker. Waking up early in the morning to get my regular cup of coffee. My goal when 
heading towards said coffee maker was to brew the cup of coffee so that when I am done getting ready for the day the coffee would be 
ready for me to consume. I started by first opening the top back compartment. I began to fill it up with water to the appropriate number of 
cups I wanted to brew. Second, I opened the compartment in the top front to lay the coffee filter into it. I then poured grounded coffee 
beans onto the filter. I close the compartments then look at the simple button layout. I set brew strength to regular then push the button 
that says "brew now". The light turns green as a feedback to me pusing on it, this indicated to me that the coffee maker is now brewing the 
coffee. I then wait for the coffee maker to fill up which allowed me to to step away and just wait for the coffee to be done. 

This coffee maker is a really simple tool that lives in many houses in particular due to it's ease of use. One of it's main strengths it's
effeincy, with a little prep of the machine you can turn it on then tend to your other needs while it does the rest. It finishes it a relativlely quick amount of time that does not need any tending too. Another high priority
I found when using it was.
